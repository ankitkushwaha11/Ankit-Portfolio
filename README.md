# Ankit-Portfolio
I created my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills as a frontend developer. The site features a modern design with smooth animations, responsive layouts, and interactive elements. It highlights my projects, skills providing a professional and engaging platform for potential clients and employers to explore my work.
